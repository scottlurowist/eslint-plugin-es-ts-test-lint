# eslint-plugin-es-ts-test-lint

An eslint plugin that looks for bad testing practices in JavaScript tests. This project currently only lints JS code but in the future it will lint both JS and TS code.

This project is currently in the very early phase of development.

Rules that are currently supported:
- no-try-catch-finally
